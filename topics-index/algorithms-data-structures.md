# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Basic Algorithms

* simple recursive functions returning an array
* merge sort - merge function
* sorting algorithms
* time complexity
* space complexity
* DFS, BFS
* time complexity for BST, list operations
* time complexity for arrays

## Basic Data Structures

* queues (queue, dequeue)
* stacks (pop, push)
* 2D arrays, matrices
* arrays, indexing, etc

## Algorithms

* Graph traversal algorithms
* iterative deepening search (less memory than BFS)
* topological sort
* weighted graphs
* dijkstraâ€™s algorithm
* spanning trees

### Dynamic Programming

## Data Structures

* Graphs
* Binary search trees
* linked lists
* priority queues
