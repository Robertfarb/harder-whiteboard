## Code Everyday!

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

1. **Polishing or adding features to existing projects**- First prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects.
1. **New projects**- Once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more features to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
1. **Coding Challenges**- All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.
