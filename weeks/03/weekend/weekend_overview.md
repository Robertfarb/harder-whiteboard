# ðŸš¨ Practice Test ðŸš¨ 

Welcome to the end of Week 3! The next step is to double down on what you've learned, and prepare for the HackerRank test that will be the last task of this section..

## Update and Practice 30 minutes of Flashcards Each Day

### Practice Alogrithms
* Do 1 Leetcode or Hackerrank Problem
* Do 1 whiteboarding problem

## Code Everyday!

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

1. **Polishing or adding features to existing projects**- First prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects.
1. **New projects**- Once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more features to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
1. **Coding Challenges**- All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.
