## How to Use this Guide
Congratulations on graduating from App Academy! Give yourself a pat on the back. You have gotten through and intense experience and now it's time to finally rest....except not! 

I repeat - doing nothing is the **worst** thing you could do right now. Now it is time to do what you came here to do. Get that job!!! You have some projects under your belt and built up for your resume but you need to keep improving your skills so that when you do get a coding challenge/technical interview you knock it out of the park.

This guide exists to strengthen your interviewing skills and your overall knowledge of computer science. The guide is broken down into day by day topics and activities to perform to get you a job as quickly as possible. 

At the end of each week you will find a HackerRank link with an assessment based on the topics from the week you just covered. That assessment will be a great way to track how well you've grasped the topics so far and what you need to improve on. Make sure you review your flashcards and notes and practice each weekend before taking the weekly assessment. 

## Practice Everyday

**Everday day you'll be learning new things, and keeping track of all the Learning Goals. The most important thing to do at the end of each day though is review! The learning goals are designed so that they can be used as Flash Card questions. Practice for at least 30 minutes a day.**

### Besides Reviewing your flash cards it is also important to keep your algorithm and whiteboarding skills up to date. 
* Do 1 Leetcode or Hackerrank Problem
* Do 1 whiteboarding problem

## Code Everyday!

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

1. **Polishing or adding features to existing projects**- First prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects.
1. **New projects**- Once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more features to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
1. **Coding Challenges**- All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.
