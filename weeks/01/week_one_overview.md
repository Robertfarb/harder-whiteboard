## How to Use this Guide
Congratulations on graduating from App Academy! Give yourself a pat on the back. You have gotten through and intense experience and now it's time to finally rest....except not! 

I repeat - doing nothing is the **worst** thing you could do right now. Sure, take a week off and rest- but after that it is time to do what you came here to do. Get that job!!! You have some projects under your belt and built up for your resume but you need to keep improving your skills so that when you do get a coding challenge/technical interview you knock it out of the park.

This guide exists to strengthen your interviewing skills and your overall knowledge of computer science. The guide is broken down into day by day topics and activities to perform to get you a job as quickly as possible. 

At the end of each week you will be emailed a HackerRank link with an assessment based on the topics from the week you just covered. That assessment will be a great way to track how well you've grasped the topics so far and what you need to improve on. Make sure you review your flashcards and notes and practice each weekend before taking the weekly assessment.
