### Algorithms

Graphs are a critical data structure in the programming industry. Today's videos are an introduction. Respectively, they cover:

1. How do we define a graph, and where are they commonly used?
2. What are the specific attributes that graphs can have, and how do we talk about them?
3. What are some ways we might store a graph in memory? What space/time complexity problems might we face?
