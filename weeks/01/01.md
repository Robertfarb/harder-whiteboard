# W1D1

Welcome to the first week of your Job Search Journey! Today, we are going to cover Graphs, review the concept of REST, and dive deeper into JavaScript prototypes. We're also going to go over a couple miscellaneous — though still very important – HTML and CSS topics.

As you study, make sure you priotize writing down and keeping track of main points that you come accross. There are several ways to do this: Buying a 5 subject notebook, or making a GitHub repository where you take notes in MarkDown are two effective solutions. Through doing this, you will have one central location to revisit everything you are learning. This will be especially helpful when studying for the HackerRank tests.

## Study

### Algorithms

So far, many of the data structures we've learned in App Academy have been linear; Linked Lists, Arrays, Stacks, Queues. This week, we are going to learn about an awesome new stucture: Graphs. The videos we have provided will cover the following concepts

- What is a Graph in computer science, and how are they useful?
- How can we implement a Graph in our code and applications?
- What are some advanced algorithms that can/must be implemented with Graphs?

We have provided three videos that we think successfully cover the fundamentals of graphs. Not only should you watch them, but you should also consider taking notes during this video. Not only will this give you a great resource to look back upon, but it will help you stay focused. Try to focus on the speaker's topic sentences, and make those your bullets.

* [Properties of Graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfYqN3fGapc)
* [Edge List](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdY1Fp9dKzs&index=40&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P)

### Web

* [REST](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/five/what-restful-actually-means)

### JavaScript

* [Prototypes](https://javascript.info/function-prototype)

### Misc

* [Benefits of HTML5](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2011/11/24/top-10-reasons-to-use-html5-right-now/)
* [media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp)

### Make Flashcards

* Explain the different ways that graphs can be represented. What are the
  pros and cons of various ways of representing graphs.
* What does it mean to be RESTful?
* Explain prototypes in JavaScript.
* List the key benefits that HTML5 introduced.
* How do media queries work?

## Practice

* Review Anki.
* Do 1 Leetcode or Hackerrank Problem
* Do 1 whiteboarding problem

## Code

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

1. **Polishing or adding features to existing projects**- First prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects.
1. **New projects**- Once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more features to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
1. **Coding Challenges**- All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.

## Network and Apply

* Reach out to 2 people
