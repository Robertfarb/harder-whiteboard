# W1D1

Welcome to the first week of your Job Search Journey! Today, we are going to cover Graphs, review the concept of REST, and dive deeper into JavaScript prototypes. We're also going to cover a couple miscellaneous â€” though still very important â€“ HTML and CSS topics.

**Make sure you review the learning goals for each section _before_ you begin to dive in**. This will give you a roadmap of what main points you should be able to talk about after getting through the material. 

Remember, write down and keep track of main points. There are several ways to do this: Buying a 5 subject notebook or making a GitHub repository of notes are two effective solutions. The goal is to have one central location to revisit everything you've learned. This will be especially helpful when studying for the HackerRank tests.

## Study

### Algorithms

Graphs are a critical data structure in the programming industry. Today's videos are an introduction. Respectively, they cover:

1. How do we define a graph, and where are they commonly used?
2. What are the specific attributes that graphs can have, and how do we talk about them?
3. What are some ways we might store a graph in memory? What space/time complexity problems might we face? 

Watch: 
* [Intro to Graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXgEDyodOJU)
* [Properties of Graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfYqN3fGapc)
* [Edge List](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdY1Fp9dKzs&index=40&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P)

#### Learning Goals ðŸ¤“ ðŸ’ª
- How do we define a graph mathematically?
- What is the difference between directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted?
- Give an example of various types of graphs (Weighted Undirected, Unweighted Directed, Unweighted Undirected, etc.)
- What makes a graph a simple graph? What attributes would make it not simple?
- What are the maximum edges in a directed simple graph? Undirected simple graph?
- What is a Path? (and variations of this term)
- Describe the levels of connectivity a graph can have (strongly connected, weakly connected).
- What are cycles?
- What are some naive ways we can store and traverse graphs? Be able to discuss time/space complexity of these approaches, and what issues we may face.  

### Web
REST (**Re**presentation **S**tate **T**ransfer) is a term we have thrown around a lot in the course. This article gives a concrete example of what it actually means. If asked this question in an interview, this reading will be your savior.

* [REST](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/five/what-restful-actually-means)

#### Learning Goals


### JavaScript

* [Prototypes](https://javascript.info/function-prototype)

### Misc

* [Benefits of HTML5](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2011/11/24/top-10-reasons-to-use-html5-right-now/)
* [media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp)

### Make Flashcards

* Explain the different ways that graphs can be represented. What are the
  pros and cons of various ways of representing graphs.
* What does it mean to be RESTful?
* Explain prototypes in JavaScript.
* List the key benefits that HTML5 introduced.
* How do media queries work?

## Practice

* Review Anki.
* Do 1 Leetcode or Hackerrank Problem
* Do 1 whiteboarding problem

## Code

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

1. **Polishing or adding features to existing projects**- First prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects.
1. **New projects**- Once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more features to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
1. **Coding Challenges**- All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.
