# Getting Started

## Key Domains of the Job Search

One of the key traits of a successful job seeker is the ability to maintain
a good balance between the different important domains of a job search.

The 4 key domains of a job search are:

* Studying
* Coding
* Networking/Applying
* Practicing

### Studying

In no particular order, here are a list of topics that you should be quite comfortable with in order to be successful on the job search:

* JavaScript
* React/Redux
* HTML/CSS
* Ruby (more important for fullstack or backend)
* SQL (more important for fullstack or backend)
* Rails
* Web Architecture
* System Design

### Coding

During the job search, you should [always be coding](https://medium.com/always-be-coding/abc-always-be-coding-d5f8051afce2):

> The more you code, the better you’ll get — it’s that simple. By coding, you’re practicing. But the best practice is focused practice. Have goals in mind, explore new areas, and challenge yourself. Over time, you should develop a portfolio of both unfinished and finished projects. GitHub is a great place to put this portfolio on display, but just having an eclectic body of work is huge.

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

1. Coding Challenges (hopefully you'll be getting several of these!)
1. Polishing or adding features to existing projects
1. New projects

During the first month of your job search:

1. Prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects
1. Then, once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more fatures to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
1. All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.

"Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest. Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works 10% more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don’t want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime. I took Bode’s remark to heart; I spent a good deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done."

“Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” — Abraham Lincoln.

We'll break down our studying into 4 main fields:

1. **Algorithms/Data Structures**- You had 2 weeks during job search curriculum to try to learn as much about algorithms and data structures as possible. Unfortunately, it's not enough, so we absolutely must continue to learn an solidify our understanding of these fundamental computer science concepts.
1. **Web Architecture**- During App Academy, there's a pretty big focus on just
   getting things to render correctly and the correct data to show. It's important
   for us to move past surface level knowledge and to gain a deeper knowledge on
   important topics like how the internet works or how to scale up a web app.
1. **JavaScript**- JavaScript is everywhere, and it's one of the topics that
   comes up the most in interviews.
1. **Other**- Of course, there's still a multitude of other things that we need
   to understand well, such as HTML/CSS, React, Redux, SQL, and so on.

### 5-subject notebook

1. Algorithms/Data Structures
1. Web Architecture
1. JavaScript

### Flashcards

There are 2 main goals when it comes to studying:

1. Understanding the concepts deeply enough to be able to explain it clearly
   and concisely in an interview
1. Retaining the concepts that you studied, at the very least for the entire
   duration of your job search

**Now that you have an understanding of how this study guide is broken down, navigate to [Week 1](./weeks/01) to get started!**
