## Key Domains of the Job Search

One of the key traits of a successful job seeker is the ability to maintain
a good balance between the different important domains of a job search.

The 4 key domains of a job search are:

* Studying
* Coding
* Networking/Applying
* Practicing

### Study

Studying is clearly an important part of the job search. Studying not only
helps prepare you for your interviews, but also helps solidify your understanding
of key concepts that are instrumental to being a successful software engineer.

We'll break down our studying into 4 main fields:

1. **Algorithms/Data Structures**- You had 2 weeks during job search curriculum to try to learn as much about algorithms and data structures as possible. Unfortunately, it's not enough, so we absolutely must continue to learn an solidify our understanding of these fundamental computer science concepts.
1. **Web Architecture**- During App Academy, there's a pretty big focus on just
   getting things to render correctly and the correct data to show. It's important
   for us to move past surface level knowledge and to gain a deeper knowledge on
   important topics like how the internet works or how to scale up a web app.
1. **JavaScript**- JavaScript is everywhere, and it's one of the topics that
   comes up the most in interviews.
1. **Other**- Of course, there's still a multitude of other things that we need
   to understand well, such as HTML/CSS, React, Redux, SQL, and so on.

### Code

"The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group: fifty pound of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on. Those being graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot - albeit a perfect one - to get an "A".
Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the "quality" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay."

"Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest. Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works 10% more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don’t want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime. I took Bode’s remark to heart; I spent a good deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done."

## Flashcards

There are 2 main goals when it comes to studying:

1. Understanding the concepts deeply enough to be able to explain it clearly
   and concisely in an interview
2. Retaining the concepts that you studied, at the very least for the entire
   duration of your job search
