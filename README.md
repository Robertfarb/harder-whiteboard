# Job Search Guide

**Purpose**: This repository is a guide for the first 12 weeks of your job search. It provides recommendations on how you should think about your job search, how you should organize your time, and what you should be working on and studying. 

## Starting With Your Goals
"When would you like to have a job offer by?" 

Think about that question for a moment. Is it in half of a year? One month? Three months? Most job seekers usually say that they'd like a job in 3 months, but fail to understand the amount of work that is required to turn that goal into fruition within that short time frame. 

3 months. That's approximately 12 weeks. That means that in 1 month, you should be 1/3rd of the way to your goal. That means that in 1 month, you should have at least been on several phone screens, with a good portion of those phone screens translating into next steps. That means in 8 weeks, you should probably have multiple onsites lined up so that at least one of them can translate into an offer. 

In other words, you should absolutely be setting intermediate goals on a daily and weekly basis, and if you're not meeting those goals, then you should be consistently re-evaluating how you can make your job search more effective and efficient. 

Here's the recommended goals for the first 12 weeks of your job search that you should measure yourself by:
1. 10 phone screens
2. 60% conversion rate on those 10 phone screens into next steps.
3. 2 onsites.
4. 1 offer
