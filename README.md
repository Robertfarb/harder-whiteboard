**Purpose**: This repository is a guide for the first 8 weeks of your job search. It provides recommendations on how you should think about your job search, how you should organize your time, and what you should be working on and studying.

## Mindset

At this point, you're likely feeling burnt out. You just went through a grueling 13 weeks of a bootcamp that was designed to push you to the limits of what you're capable of learning in a short amount of time.

At this point, what you **don't** want to do is to completely unwind and relax. Now, absolutely take a weekend to rejevuenate and rest up. But once you start the job search, you should strive to find that sweet spot of working the hardest you possibly can **at a sustainable pace**.

That means that you should definitely take care of yourself: get enough rest, eat well, exercise often, do things that you enjoy. At the same time, that should be balanced with the same level of hard work that you had during the bootcamp. **The job search is the hardest part of this entire experience. It will require your maximum effort.**

Consistency is also highly important, which is why it's important to find a sustainable pace. You want to, at all cost, avoid "0 days". In other words, avoid days where you don't make any progress towards your end goal. Every day of the job search is important. Here's one way to think about it: if your goal is to find a job in 12 weeks, then, assuming that you work 6 out of the 7 days of the week, you have 72 days to get yourself a job offer! Every day and every hour counts!
