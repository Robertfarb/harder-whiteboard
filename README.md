# Job Search Guide

**Purpose**: This repository is a guide for the first 8 weeks of your job search. It provides recommendations on how you should think about your job search, how you should organize your time, and what you should be working on and studying.

## Starting With Your Goals

"When would you like to have a job offer by?"

Think about that question for a moment. Is it in half of a year? One month? Three months? Most job seekers usually say that they'd like a job in 2-3 months, but sometimes they don't fully understand the amount of work that is required to turn that goal into fruition within that short time frame.

2 months. That's approximately 8 weeks. That means that in 1 month, you should be 1/3rd of the way to your goal: been on several phone screens, with a good portion of those phone screens translating into next steps. That means in 8 weeks, you should probably have multiple onsites lined up so that at least one of them can translate into an offer.

In other words, you should absolutely be setting intermediate goals on a daily and weekly basis, and if you're not meeting those goals, then you should be consistently re-evaluating how you can make your job search more effective and efficient.

Here's the recommended goals for the first 12 weeks of your job search that you should measure yourself by:

1. 10 phone screens
2. 60% conversion rate on those 10 phone screens into next steps.
3. 2 onsites.
4. 1 offer

## Mindset

At this point, you're likely feeling burnt out. You just went through a grueling 13 weeks of a bootcamp that was designed to push you to the limits of what you're capable of learning in a short amount of time.

At this point, what you **don't** want to do is to completely unwind and relax. Now, absolutely take a weekend to rejevuenate and rest up. But once you start the job search, you should strive to find that sweet spot of working the hardest you possibly can **at a sustainable pace**.

That means that you should definitely take care of yourself: get enough rest, eat well, exercise often, do things that you enjoy. At the same time, that should be balanced with the same level of hard work that you had during the bootcamp. **The job search is the hardest part of this entire experience. It will require your maximum effort.**

Consistency is also highly important, which is why it's important to find a sustainable pace. You want to, at all cost, avoid "0 days". In other words, you never want to have a day where you accomplish nothing. Every day of the job search is important. If your goal is to find a job in 12 weeks, then, assuming that you work 6 out of the 7 days of the week, you have 72 days to get yourself a job offer! Every day and every hour counts and is important!

With all that said, [let's get started!](./getting-started.md)
